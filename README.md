# assignment-autobotwa (AutobotWA landing)

This is a Next.js project (created with create-next-app). It contains the landing pages and UI components used for the AutobotWA assignment.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
# yarn
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm install
# pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to preview the app. Edit `app/page.tsx` to change the home page — the page updates automatically while developing.

This project uses `next/font` to optimize and load the Geist font.

## Deploy on Vercel

### Live demo

The current production demo is live at: https://assignment-autobotwa.vercel.app/

## Vercel v0 (AI-assisted) usage

The following components were initially scaffolded using Vercel v0 (AI assistant), then reviewed and refined by the team:

- `components/Hero.tsx`
- `components/Navbar.tsx`
- `components/Testimonials.tsx`
- `components/SiteFooter.tsx`

Each v0-generated component was adapted to our TypeScript setup and manually polished for accessibility, responsiveness, and visual quality — v0 output served only as a starting point.

## Interview / reviewer highlights

- UI quality: pixel-level polish, accessible components, and consistent visual language.
- Responsiveness: mobile-first layout and cross-breakpoint testing for key views.
- Project structure: `app/` for pages, `components/` for reusable UI, `public/` for static assets.
- Documentation: clear steps to run, build, and deploy the project.

If you want me to adjust the wording or move the v0 note to another location, tell me where you'd like it placed.
